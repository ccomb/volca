# pyvolca

Python client for [VoLCA](https://github.com/ccomb/volca) — Life Cycle Assessment engine over Agribalyse and ecoinvent.

> **Full guide and tutorials**: <https://volca.run/docs/guides/pyvolca/>
> **Issues / source**: <https://github.com/ccomb/volca>

## Install

```bash
pip install pyvolca
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.10 and a running VoLCA engine. Use `Server` (below) to run one as a child process, or point `Client` at any reachable instance.

## Quick start

```python
# no-test  — needs a real engine; the snippets below run against a mocked Client.
from volca import Client, Server

with Server(config="volca.toml") as srv:
    c = Client(base_url=srv.base_url, db="agribalyse-3.2", password=srv.password)
    plants = c.search_activities(name="wheat flour, at plant", limit=5)
    chain = c.get_supply_chain(plants[0].process_id, name="at farm")
    score = c.get_impacts(plants[0].process_id, method_id=c.list_methods()[0]["methodId"])
```

`Server` reads `port` and `password` from the TOML config. The engine self-stops after `idle_timeout` seconds without traffic (default 5 min).

> Examples below assume `c` is a `Client` instance — construct it with the snippet above, or against an already-running server: `c = Client(base_url="http://localhost:8080", db="agribalyse-3.2", password="…")`.

## Discover what's available

> *Which databases are loaded? Which LCIA methods can I score against? What classification systems can I filter on?*

```python
for db in c.list_databases():
    print(f"  {db.name} [{db.status}]: {db.activity_count} activities")

for m in c.list_methods()[:5]:
    print(f"  {m['methodId']}  {m['name']} [{m['unit']}]")
```

Other listings: `c.list_classifications()` returns the classification systems and their values for the current database; `c.list_presets()` returns named filter presets configured in the engine. Use `c.load_database(name)` / `c.unload_database(name)` to manage memory if a database isn't auto-loaded.

## Find an activity

> *Which activity in the database represents the product I want to assess?*

```python
plants = c.search_activities(name="wheat flour, at plant", limit=5)
for a in plants:
    print(f"{a.process_id}  {a.name} ({a.location})")
```

Each `Activity` carries `process_id`, `name`, `location`, `product`, `product_amount`, `product_unit`. Narrow the query with `geo="FR"`, `classification=`/`classification_value=` (ISIC/CPC), or set `exact=True` for an exact-name match. To search by flow name (technosphere products and biosphere flows) instead of activity name, use `c.search_flows(query=...)`.

## Inspect an activity

> *What goes into making this product? What does it emit? What's its reference unit?*

```python
detail = c.get_activity(plants[0].process_id)
for ex in detail.technosphere_inputs:
    print(f"{ex.amount:.4g} {ex.unit} of {ex.flow_name} ← {ex.target_activity}")
```

`get_activity` returns a typed `ActivityDetail`. Use `.inputs` / `.outputs` / `.technosphere_inputs` to filter the exchanges; each entry is an `Exchange` — either a `TechnosphereExchange` (an input or output of an intermediate product) or a `BiosphereExchange` (resource extracted or pollutant emitted).

## Trace the upstream supply chain

> *What's the full upstream chain — every ingredient, recursively, down to the farm or mine?*

```python
chain = c.get_supply_chain(plants[0].process_id, name="at farm", limit=20)
print(f"{chain.filtered_activities} of {chain.total_activities} upstream activities match 'at farm'")
for entry in chain.entries[:5]:
    print(f"  {entry.quantity:.4g} {entry.unit} of {entry.name} ({entry.location})")
```

For *"how exactly does this root reach a specific upstream supplier?"*, use `get_path_to(process_id, target=...)` — returns a `PathResult` of ordered `PathStep`s root → target with cumulative quantities and step ratios.

## Find downstream consumers

> *Where is this supplier used? Which products depend on it?*

```python
result = c.get_consumers(plants[0].process_id, max_depth=2, limit=10)
for cons in result.consumers:
    print(f"  depth={cons.depth}  {cons.name} ({cons.location})")
```

Returns a `ConsumersResponse` with `consumers`, pagination, and (when `include_edges=True`) the technosphere edges so callers can reconstruct supplier→consumer paths without a second round trip. Pass `classification_filters=[...]` to restrict to a category.

## Compute the life-cycle inventory

> *What are the cumulative biosphere flows (CO₂, water, methane, …) per functional unit, before applying any characterization method?*

```python
inv = c.get_inventory(plants[0].process_id, limit=20)
# inv is a raw dict — see the OpenAPI spec for the full shape.
# Substitutions are accepted: c.get_inventory(pid, substitutions=[...])
```

The inventory is what every LCIA method runs on top of. If you only need *grouped* views (by name, location, classification, etc.), reach for `c.aggregate(scope="biosphere", group_by=...)` instead — same data, summarized.

## Compute environmental impacts (LCIA)

> *What's the carbon footprint of this product? Which emissions dominate the score?*

```python
score = c.get_impacts(plants[0].process_id, method_id="EF3.1-climate-change", top_flows=5)
print(f"{score.score:.4g} {score.unit}")
for c_flow in score.top_contributors:
    print(f"  {c_flow.share_pct:.1f}%  {c_flow.flow_name}")
```

`LCIAResult` carries the score, unit, optional `normalized_score` / `weighted_score` (in Pt), and the top contributing biosphere flows with their `share_pct`.

> *Compute every impact category in one go — climate, water, land use, …*

```python
batch = c.get_impacts_batch(plants[0].process_id)
for r in batch.results:
    print(f"  {r.category}: {r.score:.4g} {r.unit}")
if batch.single_score is not None:
    print(f"PEF single score: {batch.single_score:.4g} {batch.single_score_unit}")
```

`LCIABatchResult` also surfaces formula-based scoring sets (PEF, ECS…) via `scoring_results` and `scoring_indicators`, so you can render a per-indicator chart alongside the aggregate single score.

## Drill into what drives a single impact

> *I have a climate-change score. Which biosphere flows account for it? Which upstream activities?*

`get_impacts(...).top_contributors` already returns the top biosphere flows for a single LCIA call. For a deeper or differently-bounded view — and for the *activity* attribution view — use the standalone drill-down endpoints:

```python
flows = c.get_contributing_flows(
    plants[0].process_id,
    method_id="EF3.1-climate-change",
    limit=10,
)
acts = c.get_contributing_activities(
    plants[0].process_id,
    method_id="EF3.1-climate-change",
    limit=10,
)
# Both return raw dicts — the shape is documented in the OpenAPI spec.
```

> *Which characterization factors does a method apply, and to which database flows?*

```python
char = c.get_characterization(method_id="EF3.1-climate-change", limit=20)
```

Useful for sanity-checking method coverage or building custom indicators on top of the engine's mapping.

## Aggregate flows by group

> *What are the top emitting substances? How do flows break down by category, location, or classification?*

```python
agg = c.aggregate(
    plants[0].process_id,
    scope="biosphere",
    group_by="name",
    aggregate="sum_quantity",
)
for g in agg.groups[:5]:
    print(f"  {g.quantity:.4g} {g.unit or ''} of {g.key}")
```

`scope` selects what to aggregate over: `"direct"` (just this activity's exchanges), `"supply_chain"` (cumulative upstream), or `"biosphere"` (all elementary flows). `group_by` accepts `"name"`, `"flow_id"`, `"unit"`, `"location"`, `"target_name"`, or `"classification.<system>"`.

## Compare two activities

> *How does variant A differ from variant B? Which inputs change?*

```python
from volca import compare_activities

diff = compare_activities(c, plants[0].process_id, plants[1].process_id, scope="direct")
print(f"  matched: {len(diff.matched)}, only-left: {len(diff.left_only)}, only-right: {len(diff.right_only)}")
for row in diff.matched[:3]:
    print(f"    {row.key}: {row.left:.4g} → {row.right:.4g}  (Δ={row.delta:+.4g})")
```

A client-side merge over two `aggregate` calls. Groups by `flow_id` (default) so matching is stable across naming variants. Pass `scope="supply_chain"` to compare cumulative inputs instead of direct exchanges.

## Run counterfactuals (substitutions)

> *What if I used organic wheat instead of conventional? Recycled aluminium instead of virgin? — without reloading the database.*

The engine applies a Sherman–Morrison rank-1 update, so substitutions are fast regardless of database size. Works on `get_supply_chain`, `get_inventory`, and `get_impacts`.

```python
subs = [{
    "from": "old-supplier-pid",      # the activity to replace
    "to":   "new-supplier-pid",      # the replacement
    "consumer": "consumer-pid",      # the activity that directly uses the old supplier
}]
score = c.get_impacts(plants[0].process_id, method_id="EF3.1-climate-change", substitutions=subs)
```

Multiple substitutions chain in one call — the `consumer` field disambiguates *where* in the chain each swap applies.

## Handle errors

> *The activity doesn't exist, the engine is down, or the request is malformed — what do I catch?*

```python
from volca import VoLCAError

try:
    score = c.get_impacts("nonexistent-pid", method_id="EF3.1-climate-change")
except VoLCAError as e:
    print(f"  failed: {e.status_code} — {e.body[:80]}")
```

`VoLCAError.status_code` is the HTTP status when the engine returned one; `body` is the raw response body.

## Switch databases

> *I want to run the same workflow against ecoinvent instead of Agribalyse — without rebuilding the client.*

```python
ei = c.use("ecoinvent-3.10")
ei_results = ei.search_activities(name="electricity, high voltage")
```

`Client.use(db_name)` returns a new `Client` targeting a different database while sharing the HTTP session and dispatch table — no spec re-fetch.

## Refresh IDE autocomplete after upgrading the engine

> *I just upgraded the VoLCA server. How do I get my editor to see the new endpoints?*

```python
c.refresh_stubs()
```

Pyvolca dispatches dynamically against the engine's OpenAPI spec, so it ships without `.pyi` stubs. `refresh_stubs()` refetches the spec and writes stubs into the installed package directory; restart your language server to pick them up.

## Classes

### `Client`

HTTP client for the VoLCA REST API.

Usage::

    c = Client(db="agribalyse-3.2", password="1234")
    plants = c.search_activities(name="at plant")
    chain = c.get_supply_chain(plants[0].process_id, name="at farm")

Substitutions can be passed to ``get_supply_chain``, ``get_inventory``,
and ``get_impacts`` to compute results with a different upstream
supplier — fast::

    subs = [{"from": old_pid, "to": new_pid, "consumer": consumer_pid}]
    result = c.get_impacts(pid, method_id=mid, substitutions=subs)

``depends_on`` names the databases this one links against for cross-DB
flow resolution — mirrors the ``dependsOn`` list surfaced by the relink
endpoint. Derived from the engine's declared topology, not runtime state.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `name` | `str` | — |
| `display_name` | `str` | — |
| `status` | `str` | — |
| `path` | `str` | — |

### `LCIABatchResult`

Batch LCIA: every impact category in a method collection, for one activity.

Returned by :meth:`Client.get_impacts_batch`. Carries the per-method
impact results plus any formula-based scoring sets configured in the
engine TOML (PEF, ECS, or any named set).

``scoring_indicators`` gives the per-variable normalized-weighted
breakdown of each scoring set — already multiplied by the set's
``displayMultiplier`` and expressed in its display unit (see
:class:`ScoringIndicator`). Lets callers render per-indicator charts
alongside the aggregate ``scoring_results``.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `results` | `list[LCIAResult]` | — |
| `single_score` | `float \| None` | None |

| `scoring_indicators` | `dict[str, dict[str, ScoringIndicator]]` | dict() |

### `LCIAResult`

LCIA score for one impact category on one activity.

Returned directly by :meth:`Client.get_impacts`, and nested inside
:class:`LCIABatchResult.results` (one entry per impact category).

|-------|------|---------|
| `method_id` | `str` | — |
| `method_name` | `str` | — |
| `category` | `str` | — |
| `damage_category` | `str` | — |
| `score` | `float` | — |
| `unit` | `str` | — |
| `mapped_flows` | `int` | — |
| `functional_unit` | `str` | — |
| `normalized_score` | `float \| None` | None |
| `weighted_score` | `float \| None` | None |
| `top_contributors` | `list[FlowContribution]` | list() |

### `PathResult`

Shortest upstream path from a root process to a matching activity.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `path` | `list[PathStep]` | — |
| `path_length` | `int` | — |
| `total_ratio` | `float` | — |

### `PathStep`

One step in the supply chain path returned by get_path_to.

Note: the /path endpoint emits snake_case JSON directly (built via
aeson's `object [...]` rather than generic ToJSON), so it bypasses
the engine's stripLowerPrefix transform.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `process_id` | `str` | — |
| `name` | `str` | — |
| `location` | `str` | — |
| `unit` | `str` | — |
| `cumulative_quantity` | `float` | — |
| `scaling_factor` | `float` | — |
| `local_step_ratio` | `float \| None` | None |

### `ScoringIndicator`

One per-variable entry inside ``LCIABatchResult.scoring_indicators``.

``value`` is pre-multiplied by the scoring set's ``displayMultiplier``
(configured in the scoring TOML) and expressed in the set's display unit.
``category`` names the impact category the variable was resolved from.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `category` | `str` | — |
| `value` | `float` | — |

### `SupplyChain`

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `root` | `Activity` | — |
| `total_activities` | `int` | — |
| `filtered_activities` | `int` | — |
| `entries` | `list[SupplyChainEntry]` | list() |
| `edges` | `list[SupplyChainEdge]` | list() |

### `SupplyChainEdge`

`from`/`to` are Python keywords, so they're stored under from_id/to_id.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `from_id` | `str` | — |
| `to_id` | `str` | — |
| `amount` | `float` | — |

### `SupplyChainEntry`

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `process_id` | `str` | — |
| `name` | `str` | — |
| `location` | `str` | — |
| `quantity` | `float` | — |
| `unit` | `str` | — |
| `scaling_factor` | `float` | — |
| `classifications` | `dict[str, str]` | dict() |

### `TechnosphereExchange`

An exchange with another activity (input or output of an intermediate product).

Built from an `ExchangeWithUnit` envelope: outer fields like flowName/unitName
live next to an inner `exchange` object (the discriminated `Exchange` sum).

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `flow_name` | `str` | — |
| `flow_category` | `str` | — |
| `amount` | `float` | — |
| `unit` | `str` | — |
| `is_input` | `bool` | — |
| `is_reference` | `bool` | — |
| `target_activity` | `str \| None` | — |
| `target_location` | `str \| None` | — |
| `target_process_id` | `str \| None` | — |
| `comment` | `str \| None` | None |
| `is_biosphere` | `bool` | False |

## Functions

### `compare_activities(client: Client, pid_left: str, pid_right: str, *, scope: str = 'direct', group_by: str = 'flow_id', is_input: bool | None = True, **aggregate_kwargs) -> ActivityDiff`

Diff two activities by flow_id (default) at the requested scope.

Returns three lists:
- ``matched``: flows present in both activities (with left, right, delta).
- ``left_only``: flows present only in the left activity.
- ``right_only``: flows present only in the right activity.

Default ``is_input=True`` restricts the comparison to inputs, which is the
common case for "what does this variant consume differently?". Pass
``is_input=None`` to include outputs as well.

## Type aliases

### `Exchange`

Type alias: `Union[TechnosphereExchange, BiosphereExchange]`.
